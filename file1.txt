Your average novel is a good 300 pages long, and even so-called short stories are often 20+ pages in length. But, do you really need more than a line to tell a moving story? Advocates of “flash fiction” think that you don’t. Of course, we’re not suggesting that one-line stories can replace novels or short stories, because detail and character development are important. What they do prove, however, is that it is possible to condense a story down to its absolute bare bones and still provoke some kind of emotional response.
To show you what we mean, we have fourteen one-line stories for you. Check them out!
When was the last time you read a book? It's been a while, hasn't it? If not, I envy you for the time you've taken out from your life and invested in the magical world of stories. For others like me, who haven't had a chance to get back to sipping a nice brew with a book in their hands, here's something special.
One-line stories that will stay with you long after you're done reading, and will make you pick up that book. Enjoy.
